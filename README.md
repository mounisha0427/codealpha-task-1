 overview of the project
 🔹 Objective:
To develop a simple text-based Hangman game in Python, where the player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time.

🔹 Project Description:
This is a console-based game designed using Python. The program selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player is given a limited number of attempts (6) to guess the word by entering one letter at a time. After each guess, the program updates the word display and informs the player whether the guess was correct or not.

🔹 Key Features:

Random selection of words from a list.

User input validation (single alphabet check, no repeats).

Limited incorrect attempts (6 chances).

Real-time word update and feedback on guesses.

No graphics or external libraries — only basic console I/O.

🔹 Technologies & Concepts Used:

Python core (no third-party libraries)

random module for word selection

while loop for game logic

if-else statements for decisions

String and list operations

Basic file structure and code readability

🔹 Scope & Limitations:

No GUI or audio/visual feedback.

Uses a hardcoded list of words (no API or file loading).

Designed for learning and demonstration purposes.

🔹 Outcome:
The game successfully demonstrates logic-building, control flow, and user interaction using core Python programming concepts. It fulfills all criteria mentioned in the CodeAlpha internship task list.
