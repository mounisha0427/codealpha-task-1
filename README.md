 Overview of the project
 
 🔹 Objective:
 
To develop a simple text-based Hangman game in Python, where the player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time.

🔹 Project Description:

This is a console-based game designed using Python. The program selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player is given a limited number of attempts (6) to guess the word by entering one letter at a time. After each guess, the program updates the word display and informs the player whether the guess was correct or not.

🔹 Key Features:

1.Random selection of words from a list.

2.User input validation (single alphabet check, no repeats).

3.Limited incorrect attempts (6 chances).

4.Real-time word update and feedback on guesses.

5.No graphics or external libraries — only basic console I/O.

🔹 Technologies & Concepts Used:

1.Python core (no third-party libraries)

2.random module for word selection

3.while loop for game logic

4.if-else statements for decisions

5.String and list operations

6.Basic file structure and code readability

🔹 Scope & Limitations:

1.No GUI or audio/visual feedback.

2.Uses a hardcoded list of words (no API or file loading).

3.Designed for learning and demonstration purposes.

🔹 Outcome:

The game successfully demonstrates logic-building, control flow, and user interaction using core Python programming concepts. It fulfills all criteria mentioned in the CodeAlpha internship task list.
